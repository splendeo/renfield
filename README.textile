h1. Renfield

This gem adds several interesting features to "vlad the deployer":http://rubyhitsquad.com/Vlad_the_Deployer.html

The name comes from Dracula's servant, "R. M. Renfield":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renfield .

h2. Installation

On your @environment.rb@ :

<pre>config.gem :renfield</pre>

Then execute @rake gems:install@ if needed.

The Renfield requires vlad - gems:install should install that one too.

You can also install renfield + dependencies manually by doing:

<pre>gem install renfield</pre>



Your @lib/tasks/vlad.rake@ must also include vlad. Like so:

<pre>
begin
  require 'vlad'
  Vlad.load :app => :passenger
rescue LoadError
  # do nothing
  raise "vlad didn't load!"
end

require 'renfield'
</pre>


h2. Additions:

Renfield includes:

h3. Methods

* color generation for console messages: @red@, @green@, @yellow@, @blue@, @magenta@, @cyan@. Example: @puts red('hello')@ will print a red "hello" message on the console. 
* @info@, @warning@, @error@. They are a fancy way of printing information messages, warnings and errors. Example: @info 'dump done'@
* @remote_rake@ for executing a rake on the target server. Example: @remote_rake 'db:drop'@ will do @run "cd #{current_path}; rake RAILS_ENV='production' db:drop"@

h3. Remote tasks

* @vlad:chown@ does nothing yet.
* @vlad:restart@ does @run "cd #{current_path}; touch tmp/restart.txt"@
* @vlad:confirm@ asks for a confirmation before continuing. Otherwise the rake is aborted.
* @vlad:clean_migrate@ executes @rake db:reset db:migrate@ on the target server
* @vlad:maintenance:set@ puts a "this site is undergoing maintenance" page on the site
* @vlad:maintenance:remove@ removes the maintenance page

That's all for now.
